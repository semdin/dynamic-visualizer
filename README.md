# Dynamic 3D Model Visualization with Three.js

This project enables dynamic visualization of 3D models using Three.js. The system allows users to upload 3D models and visualize them based on specific parameters.

## Features

- **Dynamic Model Loading**: Upload and display 3D models.
- **Parameter-Based Visualization**: Adjust model properties and visualization based on user-defined parameters.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for interacting with 3D models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Three.js.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/threejs-dynamic-visualization.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd threejs-dynamic-visualization
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Upload your 3D models and interact with them using the provided user interface.

### File Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
- `public/`: Contains public assets such as HTML and CSS files.
- `models/`: Directory for storing uploaded 3D models.

### Key Components

- `App.js`: Main application component.

- `Controls.js`: UI component for parameter inputs and adjustments.

### Customization

To customize the system, you can modify the following:

- **Model Parameters**: Adjust the parameters used for visualization in `ModelViewer.js`.
- **UI Components**: Customize the user interface in `Controls.js`.
